settings and documentations about the OpenStack

* "local.conf" It is the configuration in devstack to launch the OpenStack. The settings of local.conf consist of IP, interfaces, stable newton branches, neutron configurations and QoS configurations.

* "-openrc.sh" To set the required environment variables for the OpenStack command-line clients, you must create an environment file called an OpenStack rc file, or openrc.sh file. If your OpenStack installation provides it, you can download the file from the OpenStack Dashboard as an administrative user or any other user.

* "create-user-stack.sh" It is used to install the OpenStack environment in Ubuntu-OS automatically.
